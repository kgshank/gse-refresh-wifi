# Gnome Shell Extension - Refresh Wifi

Adds a refresh button in the Wifi connection screen.

Note: Gnome Shell 3.32+ automatically refreshes the wifi list every 15 s. I really don't see the need for this extension any more. 
Nevertheless, I am keeping it updated just in case its needed for some special reason.
